	- slides, lecture notes, assignments (with READMEs)
	- class: Montays at **11.30a** in HQ.007, starting Oct 2 (updated Oct 1)
- tutorials: 
	- Mondays at *9.45a* in HQ.406, starting Oct 19.
	- Thursdays at *9.45* in HW.209, starting Oct 23.
	- _nota bene: assignments typically take longer than 90'!_


???

Materialien auf Englisch, Vorlesung aber auf Deutsch.
Github orga ist closed/BIO--by invitation only
Office hours: Übungen können die meisten nicht in 90' Programmieren.

---

# Credits (Leistungsnachweis)

- written exam (90') at the end of the term
- you may bring three (3) pages notes (stapled and signed)
- you must sign up for the exam
- theoretical and coding questions

---

# Review (what you should know by now!)

## Prozedurale Programmierung
- imperative programming
- constants, variables, expressions, functions, I/O
- basic data structures (fields, arrays, lists)
- pointers &#x263A;

## Objektorientierte Programmierung
- OOP, classes and objects (and references! &#x263A;)
- basic data structures (lists, maps, etc.)
- interfaces and inheritance
- errors, exceptions and how to deal with them

---

# Agenda for Software Architecture

See https://ohm-softa.github.io/ (Syllabus)

- modularity and component based development
- UML, mostly class, component and sequence diagrams
- programming patterns: idioms, design, architecture
- assignments: tools and toolkits


Assignments are one week "behind".

# About this Class

### I'd like you to become better programmers

### Some slides, but mostly hands-on live coding (plus lecture notes!)

.skip[
All examples are found in the `/examples/` directory of the [site's repository](https://github.com/ohm-softa/ohm-softa.github.io/tree/master/examples).

# A note on (programming) languages

- class materials are in English (so is most of the internet/SO)
- examples are (mostly) in Java...
- ...but translate to C#, C++, Python, Scala, etc.
- we'll focus on the concept, not the language


---

# Software Architecture

...is a craft.

- takes practice
- takes patience
- takes diligence
- takes experience

# A word on GPT

.center[
![Goto](/assets/weresafe.png)
]

- Yes, GPT will produce correct code for most of the common programming problems
- Yes, you should use GPT.
- The point is: you need to understand what the use case requires, and then find the right coding concept.

# Speaking of `goto`

## Why would you use `goto`?

## Is it possible in C#?

## Is it possible in Java?

???

c#: yes, emulate while, break outer loops

Java: no; but break out of outer loops with labelled loops and labeled break/continue

# Agenda today

1. What is software architecture?
2. What is abstraction?
3. What is decomposition?
4. Clean Code
5. Tools

---

# Software Architecture

Thoughts?

---

# Software Architecture

## Complexity

- Ideal: linear process (analysis, draft, implementation, test, maintenance)
- Constrained by: features, budget, time
- Real world: somethings changes along the way...

## Architecture

- Result of the software development process
- Components, systems, subsystems, etc.
- V-model, agile, ..., typically recurrent at some stage

---

# Abstraction

Thoughts?

---

# Abstraction

## high level → low level

- drive to the airport
- → go straight, right, straight, left, ...
- →→ clutch, brake, ignition, put in drive, ...

.skip[
- reduce complexity by removing details
- goal: model a system from a specific point of view
]

???

see: H. Stachowiak: Allgemeine Modelltheorie, Springer Verlag, 1973

--- 

# Abstraction

## Example: programming

- hardware instructions
- assembler (low-level)
- c, fortran, java (high-level)
- code generators

---

# Decomposition

Thoughts?

---

# Stepwise Refinement

> [...] a sequence of design decisions concerning the decomposition of a task into subtasks and of data into data structures

N. Wirth, "[Program Development by Stepwise Refinement](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362577)", Comm. ACM, 1971


→ break problem down in simpler problems until solvable

---

# Functional Decomposition

- Thoughts follow the process
- Bottom-up/top-down


### Example: Withdraw cash at ATM

- insert debit card
- enter pin
- select amount
- process cash
- ...

---

# Object Oriented Decomposition

> it is almost always incorrect to begin the decomposition of a system into modules on the basis of a flowchart. We propose instead that one begins with a list of difficult design decisions or design decisions which are likely to change. Each module is then designed to hide such a decision from the others. Since, in most cases, design decisions transcend time of execution, modules will not correspond to steps in the processing.

D.L. Parnas, "[On the Criteria used in Decomposing Systems into Modules](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361623)", Comm. ACM, 1972

### Modularization and Encapsulation

> Every module [...] is characterized by its knowledge of a design decision which it hides from all others. Its interface or definition was chosen to reveal as little as possible about its inner workings.

→ Coherence and loose/tight coupling

???

probably one of the reasons OOP became so popular...


---

# Some Guidelines for Good (OO) Architecture

## High Cohesion, Low Coupling

There should be high cohesion within classes and packages, but low coupling between objects and across packages.

## Law of Demeter

In simple words: "Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.".

K. Liebherr, I. Holland and A. Riel: "[Object-oriented programming: an objective sense of style](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62113)", Proc. OOPSLA, 1988

## High Fan-In, Low Fan-Out

---

# A Bit of "Historic" Context

- early days of programming (pre 60s!) focused on procedures
- the 1970s layed the ground work (see previously cited papers!)
- 1970: Smalltalk (Xerox PARC; object oriented language)
- 1973: ML (U Edinburgh; functional language)
- 90s and 2000s: OOP widely taught as "gold standard", FP often considered "academic"
- 2010s and onwards: heavy parallelization reintroduced FP (almost hype!)
	- "old" languages introduce functional elements (Java, C++, ...)
	- Scala
	- Actor frameworks, e.g. Akka

# Clean Code

<http://www.netlib.org/clapack/cblas/dgemm.c>

---

# Clean Code

- Choose good naming conventions
- Methods should be short, concise and with few paramters
- Comments only where needed; rewrite bad code
- Java conventions?
	- [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
	- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-elasticsearch-codebase)
- Please read "Clean Code" by Prof. Tavakoli (`Teams > General > Files`)
