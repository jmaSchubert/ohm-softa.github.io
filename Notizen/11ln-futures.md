# Parallel Processing

## Working Asynchronously

Last week, we [used threads to do stuff in parallel](/10ln-threads/).
In modern application design, these threads are used to take workload off the main thread so that the actual application (e.g. a GUI or microservice) remains responsive to external input.

Using threads in Java is fairly simple: 
1. Extend `Thread` and overwrite `run()`, or create a new thread with reference to a `Runnable`
2. Call `start()` on the thread instance to signal that the thread is ready to run.
3. Optionally use `join()` on the thread instance to wait for its completion.

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from my custom thread!");
	}
});

t.start();
System.out.println("Hello from the application main thread!")

System.out.println("Waiting for thread to complete...");
t.join();

System.out.println("All done.");
```

From the main application's point of view, the code in `run()` is run _asynchronously_: The execution of the `main` method continues right after the `t.start()` call, independent of the execution of `run()`.
On a multi-core computer, the threads may actually be active at the same time, one thread per core.

There are two major drawbacks of this method: 

1. There is no (direct) way to provide arguments to or obtaining _results_ from the computation done in the thread.
	This is also reflected in the fact that `run()` does not take any arguments and has return type `void`.
2. There is no (direct) way to communicate potential exceptions that occur in the thread to the main application; the signature of `run()` can not be modified.

How could these common issues be solved?

A possible solution is to store both arguments and results inside the thread or `Runnable`, and relay possible exceptions to whoever tries to retrieve the result.

```java
public class JobWithResult implements Runnable {
	private int a, b, result;
	private Exception e;

	JobWithResult(int a, int b) {
		this.a = a;
		this.b = b;
	}

	@Override
	public void run() {
		try {
			this.result = a / b;
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Oops, an exception raised; storing for later.");
			this.e = e;
		}
	}

	int getResult() throws Exception {
		if (e != null)
			throw e;

		return result;
	}
}
```

Which can be used in your main program:

```java
JobWithResult jwr = new JobWithResult(4, 0);

Thread t = new Thread(jwr);

t.start();

System.out.println("Waiting for thread to complete...");
t.join();

System.out.println("All done.");
try {
	System.out.println(jwr.getResult());
} catch (Exception e) {
	System.out.println("Ooops: " + e.toString());
}
```


## The Future of Callables

The code above features three key parts.

1. A `Runnable` which may use external information and stores results as attributes.
	Possible exceptions raised in the `run()` method are caught and stored as attribute.
2. The main program creates and starts the thread to execute the `run()` method of the above instance.
3. The main program uses the thread's `join()` to wait for completion, and our modified `Runnable`'s `getResult()` to obtain the result (or raise a possible exception).


Let's refactor the code to separate out the recurring scheme (the mechanics) from the actual business logic (the contents of `run`).

For (1), we'll use a different interface to reflect a return type.

```java
interface Callable<V> {
	V call();
}
```

For (3), we'll introduce an interface that will allow us to retrieve the _future result_ from the `Callable`, once it's done.

```java
interface Future<T> {
	T get();
}
```

The remaining part (2) that organizes the thread logistics to run the actual task, we'll stick here:

```java
interface Executor {
	<T> Future<T> async(Callable<T> task);
}
```

As you can see, the `Executor` ties things together.
Let's see how we can make the threading work.
The incoming `Callable` needs to be wrapped into a thread, while watching for possible exceptions.
Furthermore, it must return a `Future` that, on `get()`, waits for the thread to finish and then either throws any exception that occurred or returns the result.

```java
class SimpleExecutor implements Executor {
	@Override
	public <T> Future<T> async(Callable<T> task) {
		// create anonymous Future instance
		return new Future<T> () {
			Thread t;  // handle on the thread (get needs to wait!)
			T result;  // save the result
			ExecutionException e;  // in case something goes wrong?

			// constructor block
			{
				// create a new thread and start it
				// the runnable "watches" over the task
				t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
					@Override
					public void run() {
						try {
							result = task.call();
						} catch (Exception ex) {
							e = new ExecutionException(ex);
						}
					}
				});

				t.start();
			}

			@Override
			public T get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
				// wait for it...
				t.join();

				// anything fishy?
				if (e != null)
					throw e;

				// all good, return result!
				return result;
			}
		};
	}
}
```

Putting the pieces together, the `SimpleExecutor` simplifies asynchronous execution tremendously:

```java
Executor ex = new SimpleExecutor();
int a = 4, b = 0;
Future<Integer> f1 = ex.async(new Callable<Integer>() {
	@Override
	public Integer call() {
		// can use variables from outer scope
		return a / b;
	}
});

// do other things if you like...

try {
	System.out.println(f1.get());
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
	System.out.println("The thread raised an exception: "
		+ e.getCause());
}
```


## Callables, Futures and Executors since Java 5

Since Java 5, these three parts are realized as [Callable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html) (1), [Executor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html) (2) and [Future](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html) (3).
The "real" interfaces are slightly different to allow a more faceted use.

```java
interface Callable<V> {
	V call();
}
```
```java
interface Future<V> {
	boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);
	V get();
	V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
	boolean isCancelled();
	boolean isDone();
}
```
```java
interface ExecutorService extends Executor {
	void execute(Runnable command);  // for convenience
	<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);
	Future<?> submit(Runnable task);
	<T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);
	// ...
}
```

Java 5 also introduced a [number of different executors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html), here are a few examples:

```java
Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

// executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();  // reuses threads
// executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);  // use 5 threads

executor.execute(new Runnable() { 
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
}); 
```


# Asynchronous on Steroids

The previously introduced `Executor` allows to asynchronously execute a `Callable`, only waiting (blocking) on the executing thread when calling `get()` on the `Future`.

This is convenient enough for basic use cases (e.g. re-query the database after a swipe-down gesture on mobile), but quickly reaches its limits for more complex operations, where the result of one operation gets processed by another.

For the remainder of this chapter, let's consider this rather frequent example: 
For a cloud-backed application, you write a `displayStatus()` method to 
- sign in with username and password; on success you gain a token to 
- retrieve the user's status; once received,
- greet the user.


```java
public class Workflow {
	static void displayStatus() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
		final String user = "riko493";
		final String pass = "12345";  // spaceballs, anyone? :-)

		// log in...
		Future<String> f1 = Executor.async(new Callable<String>() {
			public String call() {
				System.out.println("Authenticating with " + user + ":" + pass);
				return "secrettoken";
			}
		});

		final String token = f1.get();

		// retrieve user
		Future<String> f2 = Executor.async(new Callable<String>() {
			public String call() {
				System.out.println("Retrieving user details with token " + token);
				return "lightly sleep deprived, should get haircut";
			}
		});

		final String details = f2.get();

		System.out.println("Welcome " + user + "! You look " + details);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
		displayStatus();  // blocks until completed!!
	}
}
```

While this works, the `displayStatus()` method blocks until the status is displayed, thus blocking the remainder of the application from being responsive.
Also, reacting to execution exceptions becomes tricky: which parts should be guarded by `try-catch`?

It would be desirable to be able to chain asynchronous actions that depend on each other.
The [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) class added in Java 8 provides exactly that:

```java
class CompletableFuture<T> implements CompletionStage<T>, Future<T> {
	static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier) { 
		// ...
	}
	<U> CompletionStage<U> thenApplyAsync(Function<? super T, ? extends U> fn) {
		// ...
	}
	<U> CompletionStage<U> thenAcceptAsync(Consumer<? super T> action) { 
		// ...
	}
	CompletableFuture<T> exceptionally(Function<Throwable, ? extends T> fn) {
		// ...
	}
	// and much more...
}
```

The `supplyAsync` accepts a `Supplier<U>`, which is almost identical to `Callable<T>`, but rooted in `java.util.function` for semantic reasons.
This method is used to create a `CompletableFuture` that can then be chained with other actions.

Note the generic typing of `thenApply` and `thenAccept`: Although the `CompletableFuture` is generic in `T`, both methods return `CompletionStage<U>`, i.e. a (possibly) different generic type.

The `thenApply` method takes a `@FunctionalInterface` [Function](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html) to map values of `? super T` to `? extends U`.

The `thenAccept` method takes a `@FunctionalInterface` [Consumer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html) to act on `? super T`.

The `exceptionally` method accepts a function that maps a `Throwable` to `? extends T` to handle exceptions gracefully by providing alternate input to the next in line.

Since all those are functional interfaces, we can use method references and lambda notation for a cleaner codebase.

```java
CompletableFuture<?> cf = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "riko493:12345")
	.thenApplyAsync(creds -> {
		System.out.println("Authenticating with " + creds);
		return "secrettoken";
	})
	.thenApplyAsync(token -> {
		System.out.println("Retrieving status with token=" + token);
		return "in the mood for holidays";
	})
	.thenAccept(status -> System.out.println(status))
	.exceptionally(ex -> { System.out.println("Oops, something went wrong: " + ex); return null; });

System.out.println("All done!");
```

You can even combine (synchronize) multiple `CompletableFuture` by using its

```java
public <U,V> CompletableFuture<V> thenCombineAsync(
	CompletionStage<? extends U> other,
	BiFunction<? super T,? super U,? extends V> fn)
```

## ChatGPT 4 on `CompletableFuture`

_Retrieved on 2024-01-08, query was "give me a detailed walk-through for completablefuture in java"_

`CompletableFuture` in Java is an advanced tool for asynchronous programming, introduced in Java 8. It allows you to write non-blocking code by running a task on a separate thread than the main application thread and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion, or failure. Here's a detailed walkthrough:

### 1. Basic Creation and Usage

- **Creating a `CompletableFuture`:**
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
  ```

- **Completing a `CompletableFuture`:**
  You can manually complete it:
  ```java
  future.complete("Result");
  ```

- **Running Asynchronously:**
  Run a task asynchronously and return a new `CompletableFuture`:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
      // some long-running task
  });
  ```

  For a task that returns a result:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
      return "Result";
  });
  ```

### 2. Combining `CompletableFuture`s

- **thenApply:**
  Transform the result of a `CompletableFuture`:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> transformed = future.thenApply(result -> result.toUpperCase());
  ```

- **thenCompose:**
  Chain another `CompletableFuture`:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> chainedFuture = future.thenCompose(result -> anotherAsyncMethod(result));
  ```

- **thenCombine:**
  Combine two independent `CompletableFuture`s:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (result1, result2) -> result1 + result2);
  ```

### 3. Handling Errors

- **exceptionally:**
  Handle exceptions from the `CompletableFuture`:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<String> handled = future.exceptionally(ex -> "Default Value");
  ```

### 4. Waiting for Completion

- **join:**
  Waits for the `CompletableFuture` to complete and retrieves its result (blocking):
  ```java
  String result = future.join();
  ```

- **get:**
  Similar to `join` but throws checked exceptions:
  ```java
  try {
      String result = future.get();
  } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```

### 5. Asynchronous Methods

- **thenApplyAsync, thenComposeAsync, etc.:**
  Variants of `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, etc., that run their tasks asynchronously.

### 6. Completing on Timeout

- **orTimeout / completeOnTimeout (Java 9+):**
  ```java
  future.orTimeout(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  future.completeOnTimeout("Default Value", 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  ```

### 7. Combining Multiple Futures

- **allOf:**
  Wait for all `CompletableFuture`s to complete:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<Void> allFutures = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2, future3);
  ```

- **anyOf:**
  Wait for any of the `CompletableFuture`s to complete:
  ```java
  CompletableFuture<Object> anyFuture = CompletableFuture.anyOf(future1, future2, future3);
  ```

### Conclusion

`CompletableFuture` is a powerful tool for asynchronous programming, allowing for complex non-blocking workflows and efficient handling of concurrent tasks. It's important to handle exceptions properly and understand the differences between blocking (join/get) and non-blocking methods. With Java 9 and later versions, additional features like timeout handling make `CompletableFuture` even more versatile.



# Other Concurrency Utilities

Since Java 5, there are a number of other concurrency utilities available.

- `java.util.concurrent` provides thread safe collections
	* `BlockingQueue`: _FIFO_ queue that blocks on write-if-full and read-if-empty
	* `ConcurrentMap`: map with atomic read/write operations
- `ThreadLocalRandom` provides random numbers with per-thread randomization
- `AtomicInteger` allows atomic integer increment/decrement
- `CountDownLatch` allows for atomic counting and waiting


A frequent use for the `CountDownLatch` is batch processing across multiple threads:

```java
List<String> filesToProcess = ...;

CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(filesToProcess.size());
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

for (String f : filesToProcess) {
	ex.submit(() -> {
		System.out.println("processing file " + f);

		// countdown when done!
		latch.countDown();
	});
}

latch.await();

// shutdown the threads to allow main() to quit.
ex.shutdown();
```
